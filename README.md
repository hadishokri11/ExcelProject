Data analysis projects using Excel – starting with the Kaggle Medical Insurance Cost dataset.

## 🔍 Descriptive Analysis (Excel ToolPak)

Before diving into pivots and regressions, I ran a **descriptive stats report** using Excel’s ToolPak.  
This gave me a quick look at the basics for each column:

- **Age** → Avg around mid-30s, range from 18 to 64.  
- **BMI** → Centered around 30 (with some pretty high outliers 👀).  
- **Children** → Most people had 0–2 kids.  
- **Charges** → Very skewed! A few people had insanely high medical costs.  

This step helped me spot outliers and get a feel for the data before moving forward.
